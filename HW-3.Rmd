## Admistrative:

Please indicate

* Who you collaborated with: Jacob Dixon, Carter Merenstein
* Roughly how much time you spent on this HW: 8 Hours so far :(
* What gave you the most trouble: Interpreting questions, trying to get data in the right format, solving tiny problems and misconceptions. 
* Any comments you have: This is my first pass and obviously needs work/needs to be cleaned up


## Data

* You must first copy the file `profiles.csv` from `HW-2` to the `data` folder
in the `HW-3` directory
* We also consider all 222,540 songs played in the Reed College pool hall
jukebox from Nov 30, 2003 to Jan 22, 2009 (included in `HW-3` folder). 

```{r, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
# DO NOT EDIT THIS SECTION!
profiles <- read.csv("data/profiles.csv", header=TRUE) %>% 
  tbl_df()
jukebox <- read.csv("data/jukebox.csv", header=TRUE) %>% 
  tbl_df()
bitcoin <- Quandl("BAVERAGE/USD") %>% tbl_df()
gold <- Quandl("WGC/GOLD_DAILY_USD") %>% tbl_df()
```





## Question 1:

For this question we will be picking up from where we left off in HW-2,
specifically the OkCupid dataset.


### a)

Using your exploratory data analysis from HW-2, fit a logistic regression to predict individual's gender and interpret the results for one continuous variable (if you used one) and one categorical variable of your choice.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
essays <- select(profiles, contains("essay"))
profiles <- select(profiles, -contains("essay"))
profiles <- mutate(profiles, is_female = ifelse(sex=="f", 1, 0))

##from previous assignment

#height and makeup!
profiles <- mutate(profiles, num_height = as.numeric(as.character(height)))

ggplot(data=profiles, aes(x=num_height, y=is_female)) +
  geom_jitter(height=0.2, alpha = 0.1) +
  xlim(c(50, 80)) + 
  labs(title = "Range of Heights on Bay Area OKCupid Profiles", x = "Age", y = "Is Female")

find.query <- function(char.vector, query){
  which.has.query <- grep(query, char.vector, ignore.case = TRUE)
  length(which.has.query) != 0
}
profile.has.query <- function(data.frame, query){
  query <- tolower(query)
  has.query <- apply(data.frame, 1, find.query, query=query)
  return(has.query)
}

profiles$has_makeup <- profile.has.query(data.frame = essays, query = "makeup")
group_by(profiles, has_makeup) %>% 
  summarise(prop_female=mean(is_female)) %>% kable(.)

#fit model
model_1 <- glm(is_female ~ has_makeup + num_height, data=profiles, family=binomial)
l <- summary(model_1)
kable(l$coef, digits = 3)
```


### b)

Plot a histogram of the fitted probabilities $\widehat{p}_i$ for all users $i=1,
\ldots, n=59946$ in your dataset.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
p_hat <- fitted(model_1)

ggplot(data = NULL, aes(x = p_hat)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.2, col="blue", 
                 fill="blue", 
                 alpha = .2) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0.5, col = "red") +
  labs(title = "Histogram of Fitted Probabilities", x = "P hat", 
       y = "Count of OK Cupid Users")

```


### c)

Use a *decision threshold* of $p^*=0.5$ to make an explicit prediction for each
user $i$'s sex and save this in a variable `predicted_sex`. In other words, for user $i$

* If $\widehat{p}_i > p^*$, set `predicted_sex = 1` i.e. they are female
* If $\widehat{p}_i < p^*$, set `predicted_sex = 0` i.e. they are male

Display a 2 x 2 contigency table of `sex` and `predicted_sex` i.e. compare the 
predicted sex to the actual sex of all users. The sum of all the elements in
your table should be $n=59946$. Comment on how well our predictions fared.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}

```


### d)

Say we wanted to have a **false positive rate** of about 20%, i.e. of the people
we predicted to be female, we want to be wrong no more than 20% of the time. What
decision threshold $p^*$ should we use?

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}

```





## Question 2:

Using the jukebox data, plot a time series of the number of songs played each
week over the entire time period. i.e.

* On the x-axis present actual dates (not something like Week 93, which doesn't 
mean anything to most people).
* On the y-axis present the total number of songs.

What seasonal (i.e. cyclical) patterns do you observe?

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
jukebox <- jukebox %>% mutate(Date_format = parse_date_time(date_time, "%b %d %H%M%S %y"))
jukebox <- jukebox %>% separate(Date_format, c("Date", "Time"), sep = " ")
jukebox <- jukebox %>% mutate(week = week(Date))
jukebox <- jukebox %>% mutate(year = year(Date))
songs_per_week <- jukebox  %>% group_by(year, week)  %>% tally() 
songs_per_week$date <- as.Date(paste(songs_per_week$year, 
                                     songs_per_week$week, 1, sep="-"), "%Y-%U-%u")

ggplot(data = songs_per_week, aes(x = date, y = n)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Songs Played Per Week", x = "Date",
       y = "Number of Songs")

#seasonal patterns?
songs_per_week <- songs_per_week %>% mutate(month = month(date)) %>% select(month, n)

#tell R which months are in which seasons
winter <- c(12, 1, 2)
spring <- c(3, 4, 5)
summer <- c(6, 7, 8)
autumn <- c(9, 10, 11)

songs_by_season <- songs_per_week %>% 
  mutate(season = ifelse(month %in% winter, 'winter', 
                         ifelse(month %in% spring, 'spring', 
                                ifelse(month %in% summer, 'summer', 
                                       ifelse(month %in% autumn, 'autumn', NA)))))


ggplot(data = songs_by_season, aes(x = season, y = n)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Songs Played by Season", x= "Season",
       y = "Number of Songs")

#highly variable in winter due to break?
```





## Question 3:

Using the jukebox data, what are the top 10 artists played during the "graveyard
shift" during the academic year? Define

* the "graveyard shift" as midnight to 8am
* the academic year as September through May (inclusive)

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
jukebox <- jukebox %>% mutate(month = month(Date))

academic <- c(9, 10, 11, 12, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

academic_songs <- jukebox %>% 
  mutate(academic = ifelse(month %in% academic, 'academic', 'break')) %>% 
  filter(academic == "academic")

academic_songs <- academic_songs %>% filter(Time > "00:00:00", Time < "08:00:00")

academic_songs %>% group_by(artist) %>% 
  tally() %>% arrange(desc(n)) %>% slice(1:10) %>% kable()
```





## Question 4:

We want to compare the volatility of 

* bitcoin prices
* gold prices

Let our measure of volatility be the relative change from day-to-day in price. 
Let the reference currency be US dollars. Analyze these results and provide
insight to a foreign currency exchanger.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
bitcoin <- rename(bitcoin, Avg = `24h Average`, Total.Volume = `Total Volume`)

currency <- left_join(bitcoin, gold, by = "Date")

##make this prettier
ggplot(data = currency, aes(x = Date)) +
  geom_line(aes(x = Date, y = Avg), colour = "blue") +
  geom_line(aes(x = Date, y = Value), colour = "green") +
  labs(title = "Variation in Average Currency Prices", x = "Date",
       y = "Average Price for Day (USD)")

bitcoin_diff <- diff(currency$Avg)
gold_diff <- diff(currency$Value)

ggplot(data = NULL, aes(x = bitcoin_diff)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  xlim(-200,200) +
  labs(title = "Daily Variation in Bitcoin Prices", x = "Daily Difference in Price of Gold",
       y = "Frequency")

ggplot(data = NULL, aes(x = gold_diff)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  xlim(-200,200)+
  labs(title = "Daily Variation in Gold Prices", x = "Daily Difference in Price of Gold",
       y = "Frequency")
```





## Question 5:

Using the data loaded from Quandl below, plot a time series using `geom_line()`
comparing cheese and milk production in the US from 1930 to today. Comment on this.

* Cheese [page](https://www.quandl.com/data/USDANASS/NASS_CHEESEPRODUCTIONMEASUREDINLB-Cheese-Production-Measured-In-Lb)
* Milk [page](https://www.quandl.com/data/USDANASS/NASS_MILKPRODUCTIONMEASUREDINLB-Milk-Production-Measured-In-Lb)

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
cheese <- Quandl("USDANASS/NASS_CHEESEPRODUCTIONMEASUREDINLB") %>% 
  tbl_df()
milk <-  Quandl("USDANASS/NASS_MILKPRODUCTIONMEASUREDINLB") %>% 
  tbl_df()
```
